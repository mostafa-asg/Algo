Given a singly linked list of size N. The task is to rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes, where k is a given positive integer smaller than or equal to length of the linked list.

## Example 1:
### Input:
N = 8  
value[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}  
k = 4  
Output: 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4  


## Example 2:  
### Input:
N = 5
value[] = {2,4,7,8,9}
k = 3  
Output: 8 9 2 4 7  

### Your Task:
The task is to complete the function rotate() which takes a head reference as the first argument and k as the second argument. The printing is done automatically by the driver code.

* Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
* Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

## Constraints:
*1 <= N <= 103
1 <= k <= 103
