You are given an empty Binary Min Heap and some queries and your task is to implement the three methods insertKey,  deleteKey,  and extractMin on the Binary Min Heap and call them as per the query given below:  
1) 1  x  (a query of this type means to insert an element in the min-heap with value x )  
2) 2  x  (a query of this type means to remove an element at position x from the min-heap)  
3) 3  (a query like this removes the min element from the min-heap and prints it ).
